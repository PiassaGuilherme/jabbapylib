A small Python library that I use for my projects.

This library is quite specific for Linux, I've never tried
it under a different platform. Since this library is in an 
early stage, it is likely that it'll change a lot over time.
I plan to extend it with several new functionalities.

Usage:
------

Create a folder and put this project in that folder.
In my case I put it in ~/python/lib/jabbapylib. That is, I have this
hierarchy:
~/python/lib/jabbapylib/README                 (this file)
~/python/lib/jabbapylib/jabbapylib/config.py
etc.

Then add this folder to PYTHONPATH in your ~/.bashrc file:

PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/python/lib/jabbapylib
export PYTHONPATH

Source .bashrc (or open a new terminal), start the Python
shell and try this:

>>> from jabbapylib.say.hello import hi
>>> hi()

If you see a greetings, jabbapylib is set up properly :)
Now you can start using the library in your own projects.
